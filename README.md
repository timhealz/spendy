This is a library that I use to clean and parse financial data from my various different bank accounts. The objective is to transform the different formats that each bank provides into a clean normalized schema for ingestion into a locally hosted database.

This also supports exporting data from the database into a [ledger-cli](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) journal format.
